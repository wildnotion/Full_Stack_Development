SNHU CS-465 C-6 Full Stack Development

Applying the MEAN Stack (i.e., MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js open source tools) to develop the client-side, server-side, and other backend systems for a web application to run effectively.

Module One: Setting up MEAN tools and creating a static website (i.e., no dynamic links, buttons, actions, etc.) with Express using provided assests and altering some lines of code via the course guide.

Module Two: Modifying the file structures to align with an MVC (model, view, controller) architecture, and updating calls for headers and footers to eliminate redundant text using the Handlebars (HBS) tool.
