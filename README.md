SNHU CS-465 C-6 Full Stack Development

Applying the MEAN Stack (i.e., MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js open source tools) to develop the client-side, server-side, and other backend systems for a web application to run effectively.

Module One: Setting up MEAN tools and creating a static website (i.e., no dynamic links, buttons, actions, etc.) with Express using provided assests and altering some lines of code via the course guide.

Module Two: Modifying the file structures to align with an MVC (model, view, controller) architecture, and updating calls for headers and footers to eliminate redundant text using the Handlebars (HBS) tool.

Module Three: Adding a JSON data folder and connections to it for replacing hard-coded data with for-each loops that can dynamically fill similarly formatted templates.

Module Four: Implementing a MongoDB database with its NoSQL schema, and seeding its initial stored data using a JSON file.

Module Five: Applying a RESTful API to access the database, and ensuring the website utilizes it.
